## Contribute
If you know anyway to make the script safer,
please leave a issue and/or make a pull request.
All help is appreciated!

## WARNING/DISCLAMIER
This script does not take any real measures to 'securely' take in the password.
As stated in the rofi man pages about the -password flag
   "Hide the input text. This should not be considered secure!".
All the script does is enabling that flag and the disable history flag.
No other measures are taken so use at your own discretion.
